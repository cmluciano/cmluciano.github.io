      <description>Machine Learning on Kubernetes (my talk) Recording
Slides
There was a mix of experience levels among attendees in regards to deep learning.

Many individuals were interested in how these types of systems can be managed and shared.
I heard Magnum brought up a few times, but it does not seem to be meeting many use-cases.</description>
